Instagram is a social networking site where users can upload photos and vidoes, accompanied by text and hashtags. According to the [Instagram business page](https://business.instagram.com/), the platform has over 1 billion Instagram active accounts accounted for every month.

Since Instagram merged with the Facebook company, many of their content strategies and guidelines are shared. This includes the [Facebook: Remove, Reduce, and Inform](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/remove-reduce-inform-new-steps/) approach, as well as Instagram’s policies on [misinformation and third-party fact checkers](https://help.instagram.com/388534952086572) referring to Facebook guidelines.

The [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119/) outline content moderation policies more broadly than what is presented directly through the Facebook platform. Removal is applied to content for violations such as (a) “nudity,” (b) “self-harm,” (c) “support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups,” (d) offering “sexual services,” “firearms”, or otherwise exchanging illicit or controlled material illegally, and (e) “content that contains credible threats or hate speech.” Reducing content entails “ filtering it from Explore and Hashtags, and reducing its visibility in Feed and Stories.” Informing users is reinforced on Instagram, as with Facebook, using the [Content Warnings](https://help.instagram.com/388534952086572).
