    <h1>Ethics of Content Labeling</h1>
    <p>
      The primary aim of this project is to provide robust social and ethical
      analysis and evaluation of different approaches to online content
      labeling. The project’s central research question is: How can online
      social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, meet the
      needs and demands of society in terms of labeling informational content in
      an ethical and effective way? The project includes a focus on labeling to
      address scientific misinformation related to COVID-19, as well as a focus
      on how best to incorporate fact-checking into labeling efforts. The
      project draws on knowledge gained from current attempts at online content
      labeling in general, as well as from strong analogs to content labeling,
      such as in library sciences and food labeling. The project incorporates
      international, cross-cultural perspectives and the views of global
      researchers. Overall, this project will provide a framework for
      identifying best practices in online content labeling, as well as for
      identifying considerations that need to be addressed in order for
      different approaches to be successful from both ethical and efficacy
      perspectives. Support for this project comes from Northeastern’s Office of
      the Provost and Facebook, Inc.
